### The person

I'm Paul Boxley, a software developer living in Edinburgh. I'm passionate about helping people to solve their problems and I like working with people that share my passion.

I love programming languages that are expressive and terse. I prefer [essence over ceremony][Bini-Typing].

I like lightweight tools that perform a single task very well.

[2<sup>11</sup> tweets][2048]! Hooray!

It's been about a year since I hit [1,024 tweets][1024]. In that time a few things have changed; after four years working for the Forestry Commission I left to join the guys at ASMALLWORLD building and maintaining a huge Rails app.

I wondered what my mood had been within this period. One extremely unscientific indicator of mood is emoticons.

### Emoticons

<div id="emoticon-graph" class="graph" style="width: 530px; height: 200px;"></div>

As you can see, I have been mostly `:)`, occasionally `:D`, sometimes `:(` and hardly ever `D:` which is exactly how things should be, so that's good.

### Retweets

Over the past year I've averaged 2.61 tweets a day.

229 of those tweets (about 22%) have been retweets. That's higher than I thought it would be, so I had a look at who I'd been retweeting:

<div id="retweet-distribution-graph" class="graph" style="width: 530px; height: 200px;"></div>

Of the 229 retweets that I've made, 128 of those, or 55%, were retweets from users that I've only retweeted once. I don't even follow most of them. I wasn't aware how often I retweeted retweets, but the data suggests I do it quite a lot!

Of the people that I've retweeted three times or more, here's who I've retweeted the most:

<div id="retweet-graph" class="graph long-labels" style="width: 460px; height: 200px;"></div>

I've colour coded the charts to group people together. 

* In red are the people that I know through the [Scottish Ruby Users Group][scotrug].
* In blue are the people that I work with. 
* In green are the people that I know through my time spent helping with the [Guild Wars Wiki][gww].
* In brown are people that don't fall into any of the other groups!

At the top of the retweets is [@saveourforests][]. This is actually an account I registered myself during my time assisting in the [Save Our Forests][sof] campaign while at the Forestry Commission, so there is a little bit of self-promotion going on here, but since its creation the account has been updated almost exclusively by Tony, a former colleague, so I don't feel too guilty! And it was (and is) for a good cause!

Following on from that there's a good mix of people from ScotRUG and work who tend to say amusing or interesting things, and of course my girlfriend Lindsey, aka [@Daily_Madness][], who I am obliged to retweet from time to time to stay in her good books ;)

My [@notch][] retweets are due to my recent Minecraft addiction. The less said about that the better.

### Mentions

<div id="mention-graph" class="graph long-labels" style="width: 460px; height: 200px;"></div>

Mentions are more varied than retweets, probably because I'm more likely to have a conversation with most people than retweet them.

My colleagues [@mungler][] and [@mr_urf][] top the mentions chart, followed almost exclusively by members of ScotRUG and the Guild Wars Wiki, the only notable exceptions being my friend [@mikos][] who is not a ruby developer (shock horror) and @Daily_Madness.

### Hashtags

I feel like I have to mention hashtags since they're an important part of Twitter, but it would be pointless creating a chart for them since I only tend to use them as jokes.

The only two that I seem to have used seriously are [#yaypril][] 3 times and [#scotruby][] 7 times.

### Language

My most used word is "I". I'm so egocentric. This hasn't changed from last year.

<div id="word-graph" class="graph" style="width: 530px; height: 200px;"></div>

But short words aren't very interesting, so instead I examined my most used longer-than-four-letter words:

<div id="longer-word-graph" class="graph long-labels" style="width: 510px; height: 200px;"></div>

My most used words actually seem really positive! In fact you can almost read that last chart as a sentence.

I tend to say thanks a lot in real life, but I didn't realise this had carried over into Twitter.

I also probably say "awesome" a little too much. I am trying to replace this with "splendid".

### Summary

I'm not sure if analysing my tweets is a normal thing to do. I'm pretty certain it isn't. But it's quite fun to look closely at something that you've been doing almost absent-mindedly â€“ like reading too much into people's doodles or trying to predict the future by examining the remnants of a cup of tea.

Thank you to my Twitter followers/followees for a year full of `:)`, here's hoping for another 2,048 mostly happy tweets!

I woke up on Sunday morning, the morning after the Scottish Ruby Conference's after-party, and Lindsey asked me how the conference went. I found it hard to provide an answer that really described how I felt.

If you just want the TL;DR: It was awesome.

But that doesn't do it justice.

The charity tutorial day on Thursday was really educational. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was actually at the perfect level.

Dave Hoover's keynote set the tone for the following two days. It was inspirational.

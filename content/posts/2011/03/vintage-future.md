As a child I spent hours designing space stations and moon bases, imagining what it would be like to try and build a colony on another world. I'd use old Usborne books, with exactly these kinds of pictures inside as references.

What's surprising is *not* that predictions of the future made 50 years ago turned out to be wrong, but how much actually *has* been achieved in such a short time.

We might not all be living on the moon but the present is still a pretty amazing future.

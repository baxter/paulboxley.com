After [my previous post on terrain generation](http://localhost:9393/blog/2011/03/terrain-generation-mark-one) I got a few requests for the source code, so [I've made it available on GitHub](https://github.com/baxter/csterrain).

I'm still learning CoffeeScript, as well as terrain generation, so if you have any advice on how to make my code any cleaner or more idiomatic then I'd love to hear from you. Either at paul [at] paulboxley.com or [@baxt3r](https://twitter.com/baxt3r).

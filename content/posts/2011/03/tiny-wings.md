I've been loving Tiny Wings lately. You control a little bird that can't fly, but who can fold in its wings to slide downhill and gain momentum, before unfurling its wings to soar through the sky.

The game looks beautiful and backgrounds are procedurally generated so that it looks different every day.

It's a lot of fun and it's only 59p/99Â¢!

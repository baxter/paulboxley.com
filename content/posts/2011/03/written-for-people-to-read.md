Title: "Written for people to read"
Posted: 2011-03-08 08:30Z

In the Preface to the First Edition of the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs][sicp] Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman say:

> Our design of this introductory computer-science subject reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. **Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.**

Whenever I program I try to keep the above quote in mind.

For the last few months I have been running bitcoin.

> Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency. Peer-to-peer means that no central authority issues new money or tracks transactions. These tasks are managed collectively by the network.

So far I've generated precisely 0 coins, but it's a really interesting technology and there's some debate over whether it might be the future of currency.

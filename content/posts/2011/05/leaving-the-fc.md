Tomorrow I will have been working at the Forestry Commission for four years, and two weeks today is my last day.

I'm really excited to be moving on to something new, but it's going to be so strange, and quite sad, not seeing those people every day. And it's the people that have kept me there this long. Easily some of the nicest, friendliest people I could have hoped to meet, they've made the last four years a lot of fun. Thank you.

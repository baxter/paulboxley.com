Ifttt is a website that lets you set up tasks of the form "If this then that" where "this" is a trigger and "that" is an action. Some popular tasks include:

* If I am tagged in a photo on Facebook then save it to Dropbox.
* If tomorrow's weather forecast is rainy then send me a text message telling me about it.
* If I star a tweet on Twitter then save it to Instapaper.
* If an RSS feed is updated then post a tweet about it.

Ifttt has managed to simplify the interface between a number of popular web apps so that you can set up a whole host of tasks with the minimum of configuration. And even better, once you've created a cool task you can turn that into a "recipe" and share it with other people.

Really good stuff.

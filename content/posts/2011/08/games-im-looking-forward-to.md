Posted: 2011-08-22 20:23Z

Here are some games I'm looking forward to.

### [Journey][]

From the makers of Flower, Journey is a multiplayer game with a twist. As you wander across the desert, solving puzzles on your way to the mountain in the distance, you encounter other players but you aren't told who they are and you're not able to communicate with them. You can choose to co-operate with them or leave them and continue on your own.

### [The Witness][witness]

The Witness is a first person puzzler from a team headed by Jonathan Blow, creator of Braid. I hadn't heard about this game until I listened to Blow's talk on independent game development recently, but it sounds really interesting. A lot of people were surprised that Jonathan Blow would go from working on the extremely clever time-altering Braid to what seemed to be a Myst look-a-like, but as more information about The Witness has come out



### [Guild Wars 2][gw2]

I played a lot of the original and, while there were some things that Guild Wars could have done better, there were still a lot of things that it did right. Heavy instancing of areas was  This trailer from ArenaNet looks great.

### [The Last Guardian][trico]

From Fumito Ueda and SCEJ, The Last Guardian tells the story of a boy and his giant mean-eating griffon creature.

The spiritual sequel to Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, it looks like The Last Guardian is going to further explore relationships and interaction.

### [Fez][]

I [already mentioned Fez][fez-post] in an earlier post. I said this:

> Fez is a 2.5D platformer by Polytron where you rotate the gameworld by 90Â° at a time.

### [Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet][itsp]

This side scrolling alien spaceship exploratory shooter is already out but I haven't bought it yet, so technically I'm still looking forward to it.

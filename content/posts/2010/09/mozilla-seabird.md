Title: Mozilla Seabird phone â€“ amazing but only a concept
Posted: 2010-09-25 22:25Z

I just watched the video for the [Mozilla Seabird phone][1], and it left me both impressed and frustrated.

Frustrated because there's a vast difference between coming up with a concept and designing a product.

> Q: Does Mozilla have plans to produce a mobile phone?

> A: No. Mozilla produces Firefox for Mobile, the popular Firefox browser for mobile phone systems such as Nokia Maemo and Android.

I appreciate that in this instance Mozilla are just showing off what's possible, but it's important to remember that this is fiction.

One of the reasons that companies like Apple hold a lot of respect with me is that they only show products when they are actually *products*. Showing off concepts is fine if you can deliver on those concepts, but if you can't then you are just setting up your customer for disappointment.

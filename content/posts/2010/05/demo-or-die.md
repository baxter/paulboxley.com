Reg Braithwaite has a posterous! His first post, *Demo or 
Die*, seems more inline with his ['Raganwald'][1] blog 
than [homoiconic][2]:

> There's nothing like a demo with a date attached to 
> really focus your efforts. Even if progress is slow, a 
> weekly demo establishes a heartbeat, a kind of informal 
> iterative development process.

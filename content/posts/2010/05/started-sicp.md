Today was a public holiday so after a nice walk this 
afternoon I decided to start reading *Structure and 
Interpretation of Computer Programs*. I'm only at the 
preface to the first edition, but I couldn't help but quote 
a passage:

> First, we want to establish the idea that a computer 
> language is not just a way of getting a computer to 
> perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal 
> medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, 
> programs must be written for people to read, and only 
> incidentally for machines to execute.

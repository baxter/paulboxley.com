Title: Started SICP

Today was a public holiday so after a nice walk this 
afternoon I decided to start reading [*Structure and 
Interpretation of Computer Programs*][sicp] (I'm reading the [hard copy][sicp-amazon]). I'm only at the 
preface to the first edition, but a passage stood out for 
capturing something I've wanted to say for a while:

> First, we want to establish the idea that a computer 
> language is not just a way of getting a computer to 
> perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal 
> medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, 
> programs must be written for people to read, and only 
> incidentally for machines to execute.

Any programming language is capable of performing exactly 
the same tasks as any other programming language. So why 
don't we all use COBOL, or assembly, or binary? 

Because different programming languages are suited to 
articulating solutions in different contexts.

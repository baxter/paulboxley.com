As I [said yesterday][1]:

> Despite a 1% increase in their share of national votes 
> the Liberal Democrats have lost five seats so far.

A group called 'Take Back Parliament' are demanding 
electoral reform.

> This Parliament does not represent us. We demand fair 
> votes now. There must never again be an election under 
> this broken system.

Title: Links
Posted: 2010-05-31 21:50Z

The majority of my posts are links to other websites. I've altered the feed to try to make things clearer. Now posts that are links start with the domain name of the site that they link to, so this:

> A link to a fun youtube video

becomes this

> [youtube.com] A link to a fun youtube video.

Let me know if this breaks anything, or if you have any suggestions for improvements.

Fascinating:

> Some of the newly inserted material consists of brief 
> reaction shots, just a few seconds long, which establish 
> or accentuate a character’s mood. But there are also 
> several much longer scenes, including one lasting more 
> than seven minutes, that restore subplots completely 
> eliminated from the Paramount version.
> 
> For example, the “Thin Man,” who in the standard version 
> appears to be a glorified butler to the city’s 
> all-powerful founder, turns out instead to be a much 
> more sinister figure, a combination of spy and detective.

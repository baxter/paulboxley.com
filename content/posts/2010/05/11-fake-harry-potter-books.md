China is famous for many things &mdash; the Great Wall, ancient 
dynasties, a communist doctrine that combines 
elements of marxism and free market economics and, of 
course, fake Harry Potter books. 

11points.com has compiled a list of eleven Chinese bootleg 
books, including:

* Harry Potter and the Leopard Walk-Up-To Dragon (in which 
  the Hobbit is retold with Harry as the central character)
* Harry Potter and the Chinese Overseas Students at the 
  Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry (which kind of
  explains itself)
* Harry Potter and the Half-Blooded Relative Prince (which 
  sounds similar to an actual book in the series, however 
  in this book Harry is the villain)

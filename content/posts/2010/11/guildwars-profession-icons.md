Title: Guild Wars Profession Icons
Posted: 2010-11-12 08:55Z

A few years ago I was heavily involved in the [Guild Wars Wiki][gww], and before that I had been involved in the unofficial [GuildWiki][gwiki] (now a Wikia site).

Among the many things that I contributed to both projects was a set of icons for each profession in the game designed using the [Tango icon guidelines][tango].

The Solar Impulse project, which aims to build a manned solar powered plane that will circumnavigate the globe in less than four weeks, have completed their first night flight test.

The HB-SIA flew throughout the day, charging its batteries before operating at night.

Pretty amazing that solar and battery technology have advanced to the point where this is possible.

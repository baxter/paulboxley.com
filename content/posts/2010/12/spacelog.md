Spacelog is a project which aims to take the original transcripts from space flights and turn them into stories. It's well designed and the photography used on the site is excellent.

I especially like that you can [link to specific sections of a transcript](http://apollo13.spacelog.org/03:08:37:33/03:08:38:45/#show-selection).

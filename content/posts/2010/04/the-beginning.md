Title: The beginning
Posted: 2010-04-05 11:22Z

I had been toying with the idea of starting to blog again for a while, but after attending the [Scottish Ruby conference][1] last week I decided to bite the bullet and get on with it.

I've built my own simple blogging engine. I don't like reinventing the wheel but I wasn't happy with the alternatives.

This blog is file based -- each post is a markdown file. I store posts alongside the source code in git and deploy to [Heroku][2]. The code for the site is [available on github][3].

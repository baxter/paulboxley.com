Twitter are introducing new advertising functionality that they call "Promoted Tweets":

> You will start to see Tweets promoted by our partner advertisers called out at the top of some Twitter.com search results pages. We strongly believe that Promoted Tweets should be useful to you. We'll attempt to measure whether the Tweets resonate with users and stop showing Promoted Tweets that donâ€™t resonate.

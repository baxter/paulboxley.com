Web: Unfortunately the custom font that I use doesn't properly style '&#x107;'. My apologies.

I discovered Marina Abramovi&#x107; [via 
Kottke][kottke-abramovic], who linked to the tumblr blog 
[Marina Abramovi&#x107; Made Me Cry][abramovic-cry].

> Abramovic sits at a table in silence, and museum guests 
> can sit across from her and stare.

> Some people couldn't handle the heat.

The full set of photos can be found on [MoMA's flickr 
account][moma-flickr].

I spent a little time reading about Marina Abramovi&#x107; and she 
is absolutely fascinating. She started performance art in 
the 70s and in one exhibit, titled *Rhythm 0*, she placed 72 
objects on a desk, including a gun and a bullet, and allowed 
the audience to use those objects on her in any way they 
chose. She said about the performance:

> The experience I learned was thatâ€¦if you leave decision 
> to the public, you can be killed.
>
> ... 
>
> I felt really violated: they cut my clothes, stuck rose 
> thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my 
> head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive 
> atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood 
> up and started walking toward the public. Everyone ran 
> away, escaping an actual confrontation.

### Epilogue

I was browsing through MoMA's Flickr set for the exhibit 
and noticed [this comment beneath a picture of a woman in 
a hijab][comment].

kendo_ is right, the same woman appears at least 6 times in 
various guises:

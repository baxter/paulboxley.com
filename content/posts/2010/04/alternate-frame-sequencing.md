3D glasses in cinemas tend to use polarising filters in both the projectors and the glasses to limit what the left and right eyes see. It seems like some 3DTVs will use radio waves to synchronise with the glasses so that when the image on the screen is for the left eye then the right eye in the glasses will be blacked out.

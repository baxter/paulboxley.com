I'm a huge fan of [Jos Buivenga's 'Museo'][museo]. It looks beautifully crafted at every weight and is easy to identify thanks to its odd semi-serifs.

That it features ligatures and multiple language support makes it all the more surprising that this font is free at most weights â€“ and it explains why I have been seeing it everywhere, from [high-street optician signs][black-lizars] to [album covers][museo-hits].

Despite its charm, the more I see it used the less I want to use it myself. Perhaps its popularity is a double-edged sword.

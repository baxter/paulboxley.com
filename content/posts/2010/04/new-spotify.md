Title:  New Spotify plays local files and features friend listPosted: 2010-04-28 18:12ZURL:    http://blog.hunch.se/2010/04/spotify-next-generationI love using Spotify but, understandably, not all of the music I like is available online, which means switching to iTunes for certain songs â€“ so this will save me some valuable keystrokes!Seems like there is a staggered rollout, so I'm still waiting for mine to update.

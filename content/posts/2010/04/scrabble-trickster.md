I originally read on kottke.org that Scrabble were introducing new rules that would allow proper nouns. It transpires that this is not the case:

> Mattel, which owns the rights to Scrabble outside of North America, is introducing a game this summer called Scrabble Trickster. The game will include cards that allow players to spell words backward, use proper nouns, and steal letters from opponents, among other nontraditional moves.

Move along, nothing to see here.

It can be a heartbreaking experience when you've spent days or weeks or months working on a feature only to discover that it is either irrelevant or unsuitable. The level of work that went into some of these unshipped features only highlights the commitment to quality that the [Pixelmator][1] team have.

Incidentally it is an amazing product!

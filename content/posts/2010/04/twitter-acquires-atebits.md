> Twitter, which has flourished thanks to tools built by outside developers, is taking more of those tools under its own wing. In a move that is sure to rattle its developers, Twitter has agreed to acquire Atebits, the start-up that makes the Tweetie apps for using Twitter on Mac computers and iPhones. The acquisition price was not disclosed

Tweetie 2 for iPhone is easily my favourite Twitter app, so from Twitter's point of view I think this is a good acquisition. While there's a risk that an official Twitter app for mobiles and desktops could threaten other Twitter-client developers it could also mean that Twitter improve their API benefitting everyone.

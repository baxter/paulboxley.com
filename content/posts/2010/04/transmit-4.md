More new software, fantastic Mac FTP software Transmit is 
now at version 4 and looks seriously impressive. Aside 
from the gorgeous makeover it's a lot faster:

> Transmit 3 was fast. The Transmit Turbo engine in Coda 
> was faster. Transmit 4 is scary, wicked fast. We tuned 
> and tweaked the new Transmit Twin-Turbo engine to get 
> you hauling up to 25 times faster.

And a whole host of other features, including the ability 
to mount online storage, like FTP or Amazon S3, as a drive
in Finder.

Congratulations, [Panic][]!

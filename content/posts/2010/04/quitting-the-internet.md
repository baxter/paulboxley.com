James Sturm, a cartoonist and graphic novelist, is quitting the Internet for 4 months and blogging about it. Every two weeks he will send a post to Slate.com and they will publish it on his behalf.

I'm a heavy Internet user and, perhaps because of that, so are most of the people I know. I think most of them have questioned whether the time that they spend on the Internet is wasted time.

I'm hoping James will find something insightful to say on the matter.

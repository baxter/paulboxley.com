Title: Thoughts so far on E3 2010
Posted: 2010-06-16 07:17Z

* [Portal 2][portal2] looks amazing, although the announcement itself is not surprising.
* [Steamworks][] on PS3 is a clever move by Valve to give them leverage on the 360. (See [this Penny Arcade post][pa-e3]).
* The [3DS][] has got some [favourable][3DS-ars] [reviews][3DS-guardian], but I'm not sure how Nintendo are going to market the device when you can't see 3D on TV.
* New [Goldeneye][] was very surprising, and new Kirby and Zelda were also welcome additions.
* [360 redesign][360] looks nice. The cynic in me wonders if a major goal in the new design is cutting down on Red Ring Of Death.
* The [Kinect][] and the [Move][] are both too similar to, and more expensive than, the Wii.
* That said, Tetsuya Mizuguchi of Rez fame is developing a shooter for both Kinect and Move called [Child of Eden][eden]. I would probably buy Kinect or Move for this game alone.

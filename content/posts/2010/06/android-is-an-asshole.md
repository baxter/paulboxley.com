David Pogue [reviewed the Sprint Evo 4G][pogue].

Gruber [summarised it][gruber].

Jack Shedd observes that there is a [trend when reviewing Android phones][shedd]:

> Their flaws, always major and always awe-inspiring in their insipidness, are inevitably attributed more to the device itself than to the underlying Android operating system. Thereâ€™s a sense, not just from reviewers, but from fans of the device, that what Android really needs is just killer hardware.
> 
> Which is just absolute horse shit.
> 
> Android is an asshole of an operating system.

In my own experience the only advantage that any Android device has had over the iPhone is the G1's hardware keyboard. In fact, the G1 with the original Android OS is the best Android device I have used so far.

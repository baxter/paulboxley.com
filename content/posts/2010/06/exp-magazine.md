Cory Schmitz wants to make a different kind of video game magazine:

> The purpose of EXP is to reject the idea that a video game magazine has to be be comprised of reviews and previews of the latest games. It hones in on the gap between game magazines and design magazines, embracing the relationship between video games and artists. A big focus of the magazine is the experience games provide, and how that is a great inspiration for creative people to draw from.

Some [samples from the magazine][1] are available.

I'm really looking forward to getting a copy of this.

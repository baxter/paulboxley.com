I've spent this evening bowling (badly) and thinking about ways to simplify working with the canvas element. On returning home I stumbled across the above blog post on Dreaming In Javascript. I didn't think I would like modifying the canvas methods in this way, and seeing the code I still have my reservations, but it's not as bad as I thought.
